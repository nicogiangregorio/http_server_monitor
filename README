This is a very simple HTTP server monitor.

It performs a check on "server-status" of HTTPD and shows some information about server activity.
Obviously, it requires that mod_status is enabled on the server to be checked.

Source code is realized on 50% using Boost Asio and following the following example:

I used mainly Boost libraries for realizing threadpool, thread management, bind, etc.
